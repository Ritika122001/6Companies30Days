// 787. Cheapest Flights Within K Stops
// There are n cities connected by some number of flights. You are given an array flights where flights[i] = [fromi, toi, pricei] indicates that there is a flight from city fromi to city toi with cost pricei.
// You are also given three integers src, dst, and k, return the cheapest price from src to dst with at most k stops. If there is no such route, return -1.
// Example 1:

// Input: n = 4, flights = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[2,0,100],[1,3,600],[2,3,200]], src = 0, dst = 3, k = 1
// Output: 700
// Explanation:
// The graph is shown above.
// The optimal path with at most 1 stop from city 0 to 3 is marked in red and has cost 100 + 600 = 700.
// Note that the path through cities [0,1,2,3] is cheaper but is invalid because it uses 2 stops.
