// 837. New 21 Game
// Alice plays the following game, loosely based on the card game "21".
// Alice starts with 0 points and draws numbers while she has less than k points. During each draw, she gains an integer number of points randomly from the range [1, maxPts], where maxPts is an integer. Each draw is independent and the outcomes have equal probabilities.

// Alice stops drawing numbers when she gets k or more points.

// Return the probability that Alice has n or fewer points.

// Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer are considered accepted.
// Example 1:

// Input: n = 10, k = 1, maxPts = 10
// Output: 1.00000
// Explanation: Alice gets a single card, then stops.
// Example 2:

// Input: n = 6, k = 1, maxPts = 10
// Output: 0.60000
// Explanation: Alice gets a single card, then stops.
// In 6 out of 10 possibilities, she is at or below 6 points.
